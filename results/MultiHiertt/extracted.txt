#If the results of the qualitative assessment are not conclusive, a quantitative goodwill test is performed The quantitative goodwill test consists of two steps: the first step compares the estimated fair value of each reporting unit with its estimated net book value, which includes goodwill and identifiable intangible assets If the reporting unit’s estimated fair value exceeds its estimated net book value, goodwill is not impaired; Changes in the estimates and assumptions used in our goodwill impairment testing could result in future impairment losses, which could be material Additionally, when a portion of a reporting unit is disposed, goodwill is allocated to the gain or loss on disposition based on the relative fair values of the business or businesses disposed and the portion of the reporting unit that will be retained When determining the fair value of the businesses disposed of and the reporting unit to be retained, we use estimates and assumptions similar to those used in our impairment analysis; If the estimated fair value of a reporting unit is less than its estimated net book value, the second step of the goodwill test is performed to measure the amount of impairment, if any An impairment is equal to the excess of the carrying amount of goodwill over its fair value During the fourth quarter of 2016, the firm assessed goodwill for impairment using a qualitative assessment; Therefore, the firm determined that goodwill for all reporting units was not impaired; During 2016, the firm’s net earnings, pre-tax margin, diluted earnings per common share, return on average common shareholders’ equity, and book value per common share increased compared to 2015 Additionally, the firm’s overall cost structure declined, reflecting the impact of expense savings initiatives The firm also evaluated firm and industry events, noting that there were no events, entity-specific or otherwise, since the 2015 quantitative goodwill test that would have had a significant negative impact on the valuation of the firm’s reporting units; As a result of the qualitative assessment, the firm determined that it was more likely than not that the fair value of each of the reporting units exceeded its respective carrying amount Notwithstanding the results of the qualitative assessment, since the 2015 quantitative goodwill test determined that the estimated fair value of the Fixed Income, Currency and Commodities Client Execution reporting unit was not substantially in excess of its carrying value, the firm also performed a quantitative test on this reporting unit during the fourth quarter of 2016 In the quantitative test, the estimated fair value of the Fixed Income, Currency and Commodities Client Execution reporting unit substantially exceeded its carrying value
